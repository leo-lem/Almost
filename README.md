# Almost?

A reflective habit tracker focused on learning from near misses. Built as a Firebase-powered portfolio project.

## Goals

- Track daily challenges and “almosts” — things you intended to do but didn’t  
- Write short notes on what went wrong and how to improve  
- Visualize patterns and improve consistency over time  
- Optionally share entries with trusted peers or mentors

## Tech

- SwiftUI  
- Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Analytics)  
- Clean MV pattern  
- Planned: iCloud sync, sharing, streak logic, and reflection prompts

## Status

App Store version is a minimal stub. New version in progress, focused on Firebase integration and improved UX.
